Here are some of the projects I've been involved in. Sometimes as a designer, sometimes as a developer, often as both!

## Carol Quintanilha (2014)

Brazilian photographer *Carol Quintanilha* website had to be minimal and fast so to never get on the way of her beautiful work.

For the backend we used [Kirby](https://getkirby.com), the excellent file-based CMS, which allows her to add or remove content easily through FTP.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/carolquintanilha01.png,/images/projects/carolquintanilha02.png"
%}

## Bazar Pamplona (2012)

My friends from the indie rock band *Bazar Pamplona* needed a website to promote their sophomore album, *Todo Futuro é Fabuloso*.

Biggest constraint here was adapting the lovely artwork by [Gustavo Gialuca](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gialuca/) into a digital project.

(You can't tell from the static image, but those flying saucers were moving in parallax!)

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/bazarpamplona01.png,/images/projects/bazarpamplona02.png"
%}

## Kung Fu (2010)

Kung Fu, an independent audio producing company from South of Brazil, needed to integrate a more robust portfolio section onto their one-pager. Instead of rebuilding the site using some CMS, I suggested we used Vimeo's API (their work was already being uploaded there anyway).

In collaboration with [Agência Preza](https://twitter.com/moskito).

	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/kungfu02.png,/images/projects/kungfu01.png"

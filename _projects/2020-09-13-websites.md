Here are some of the projects I've been involved in. Sometimes as a designer, sometimes as a developer, often as both!

## Carol Quintanilha (2014)

**Carol Quintanilha** is a photographer, DP and documentary filmmaker based in São Paulo, Brasil. Some of her clients include *Greenpeace*, *Kodak* and *GNT*.

She's a visual artist, so it was crucial that the interface didn't get in the way of her work. A colour palette of white for background, dark grey for copy, and a dash of yellow for emphasis. Helvetica Neue is the only font family and 15pt is the only size.

Site also has to be fast, so the only images being loaded are the ones from the portfolio.

Another problem we were trying to solve was: it should be easy for her to keep the site up to date. An issue she had from previous (WordPress-based) versions of the site was that every time she had to add a new piece or remove an old one, she had to follow a number of complicated steps.

So, for the backend we decided to go with [Kirby](https://getkirby.com), the excellent file-based CMS. Although it does offer an admin interface, Kirby also allows her to add or remove content easily through FTP, a technology she was already familiar with. Adding a new page to the site can be as simple as dragging and dropping a folder with a bunch of `.jpegs` and a `.txt`.

## Bazar Pamplona (2012)

My friends from the indie rock band *Bazar Pamplona* needed a website to promote their sophomore album, *Todo Futuro é Fabuloso*.

Biggest constraint here was adapting the lovely artwork by [Gustavo Gialuca](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gialuca/) into a digital project.

(You can't tell from the static image, but those flying saucers were moving in parallax!)

## Kung Fu (2010)

Kung Fu, an independent audio producing company from South of Brazil, needed to integrate a more robust portfolio section onto their one-pager. Instead of rebuilding the site using some CMS, I suggested we used Vimeo's API (their work was already being uploaded there anyway).

In collaboration with [Agência Preza](https://twitter.com/moskito).

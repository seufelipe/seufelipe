I joined the Medit team as the first version of the app was being released in the AppStore. This page will be updated with all the good stuff (and some of the bad) I learned from my time as designer there.

### A stronger first impression

For the first versions of our Home screen we tried the ever popular vertical infinite scroll. We quickly started noticing a few issues: screen became too cluttered. Users were finding it too complicated. There was a disconnect from our marketing messages: we were promising this new thing and delivering the same old "feed" (boring!).

Instead of making buttons bigger and adding pointers and helpers, we decided to take a step back. After some research a few good rounds of internal testing, we rolled out a new version of the home screen. Much more attractive and interactive, we use cards for featured content and important information and quick lists and carousels for the curated content.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/medit08.png,/images/projects/medit05.png"
%}

This ended up increasing the time spent in app (people were exploring more) and opened up possibilities for extra revenue through promoted content.

### A more dynamic brand

Streamlined the logo and added alternate lockouts and colour variants to make it stronger across different channels. Developed a more flexible colour palette with multiple tints and shades to empower the marketing team.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/medit04.png,/images/projects/medit06.png,/images/projects/medit07.png"
%}

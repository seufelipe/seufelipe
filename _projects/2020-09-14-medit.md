As lead designer at Medit — a multi-platform app helping healthcare professionals discover and organise content using AI and thoughtful design — I was directly involved in every stage of the product cycle: from ideation, research, building & testing prototypes (InVision, Figma), to designing screens (for iOS following Human Interface Guidelines and for Android following Material Design), writing copy (we used a Copy Doc) and coordinating handoff with the developers (first through Sketch + Zeplin, than through Figma), doing QA and collecting and processing user feedback.

Worked with the founders on expanding the branding: streamlined the logo, developed a typography system and colour palettes, outsourced iconography and illustrations.

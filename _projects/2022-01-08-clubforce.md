Clubforce is a sports club management platform for memberships, fundraising, communications and promotion. They are a market leader, with over 10 years history. Built for volunteers, by volunteers.

I joined the company as First Designer, to work on the next generation of the platform.

### A components library

The first version of the web platform had been built by a small group of full-stack engineers. It was in pretty good shape, but two great challenges had to be addressed:

- it had to scale
- re-branding: we had to consider how to integrate a new logo, typography and colour scheme

First step was doing an UI inventory. We found out the interface was made of equal parts Angular Material, Bootstrap and custom-built components.

We ended up with a component library on Figma, which brought design close to code and allowed us to iterate on and deliver interfaces consistently faster.

### Tokens for better website customisation

Club Websites were an important part of Clubforce Modernisation. An easy way for clubs to get closer to their supporters: posting news & updates, contact details and information, and a shop front for fundraising and memberships.

Customisation is a big part of this. Clubs want their websites to look & feel unique. Colours are one of the most recognisable aspects of a club identity.

We researched the most popular colours for each county in Ireland and used that as a starting point. We offer two options: one primary and one secondary. CSS variables are updated based on the user choices.

### Progressing the company's UX maturity level

I worked with the Head of Product on progressing the company UX maturity from the current low emergent level. Our main focus was on increasing awareness and improving processes.

That was an ongoing effort and in practical terms it means small things such as: dedicated Slack channels and Confluence spaces for design discussions, an internal design blog and, a series of talks and workshops.

Hi. It's Felipe. For more than a decade I've been using design to solve problems and helping companies and individuals to get their business online.

Throughout the years I've worked with the most excellent folks on digital products for photographers, alternative rock bands, Michelin starred restaurants, international film festivals and a lot more. I have designed and built websites of all sizes, from static one-pagers to responsive e-commerces with thousands of products. I have designed multi-platform apps and helped my friends with their blogs.

I know how to work alone but I believe I'm at my best when I'm able to collaborate with other people. I've been told I'm a good listener. I'm good at asking why.

On my free time I enjoy watching football, talking about movies, reading self-help books and playing *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*.
